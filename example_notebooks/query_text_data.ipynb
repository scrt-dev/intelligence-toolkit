                "Lazy GraphRAG is a hybrid approach that requires no summarization-based index (which is expensive, especially if the user only has a few queries). Instead, it relies purely on an embedding-based index for input text chunks (cheap, fast) augmented by the concept graph of noun-phrase cooccurrences extracted from these chunks (free, fast). It works as follows:\n",

                "- Given a query, text chunks are ranked using vector-based semantic search.\n",
                "- Chunk rankings are used to determine community rankings in the concept graph.\n",
                "- In community rank order, the top k chunks are subject to a rapid relevant test (cheap, fast). If relevant chunks are found, the community is retained, otherwise it is discarded.\n",
                "- After n communities fail to return any relevant chunks, the \"iterative narrowing\" process repeats with remaining communities in rank order.\n",
                "- The process terminates when no more testable chunks exist or a predefined testing budget is reached (e.g., 100 relevance tests).\n",
                "\n",
                "The advantages of this approach include:\n",
                "\n",
                "- A balance of best-first (semantic search) and breadth-first (community structure) approaches for any testing budget\n",
                "- Very fast and almost free - suitable for one-off and exploratory queries before committing to a full indexing\n",
                "- Easily accommodates dynamic contexts where new texts/chunks are streaming in to the dataset (supported in the current implementation)\n",
                "- Provides a consistent level of \"effort\" for a fixed test budget, providing various standards of answers to questions (e.g., global questions) for which there is no ground truth (e.g., 1000 chunks = gold standard, 500 chunks = silver standard, 100 chunks = bronze standard, etc.)\n"
